## About The Project

This game is designed to make learning active rather than passive. Instead of just reading material, the player actively engages with challenges, customizes their learning focus, and sees tangible progress through an interactive game system.

### Core Concept

The player's goal is to master various subjects by collecting, managing, and playing "challenge cards." Each card represents a specific task within a subject (e.g., "Solving linear equations" in Math or "Conjugating verbs" in a language). By building a deck of these cards, the player tailors their own learning sessions.

### Gameplay Loop

A game round follows a simple, rewarding cycle:

1.  **Choose a Challenge:** The player is dealt 3 random cards from their deck and selects one.
2.  **Solve the Task:** The game generates a specific problem based on the chosen card (e.g., "What is 524 in hexadecimal?").
3.  **Get Rewards or Feedback:**
    - **On success:** Earn currency and experience points (XP).
    - **On failure:** Lose a life point and see the correct answer, ensuring a learning moment.
4.  **Continue:** The loop repeats until the player runs out of life points, after which they return to the main hub with their earnings.

## Key Features

-   **Gamified Learning:** A core loop that rewards knowledge and successful application.
-   **Customizable Deck-Building:** Players create decks of "challenge cards" to focus on subjects they want to improve.
-   **RPG-style Progression:** Use XP to unlock powerful, permanent upgrades in subject-specific and general skill trees.
-   **Modular Subject System:** Easily expandable with new subjects like Math, Programming, Languages, Engineering, and more.
-   **In-Game Shop:** Use earned currency to buy new cards, expanding the range of available challenges.
